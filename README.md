Practicing ABAP Objects: Head First Design Patterns


This project consists of code examples in ABAP based on the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124) by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson.

All sample code was created for ABAP 7.4 and makes use of the demo output classes for SAP GUI.
